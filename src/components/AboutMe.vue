      Hello, my name is Josiah Aubin and I am currently a software developer at In Time Tec, a global software company located in Meridian, Idaho.
      <br />
      <br />Before joining the software development workforce I attended Boise CodeWorks, a full-stack software development bootcamp. During my time at BCW I learned multiple front end and back end technologies, as well as completing multiple projects that met specific requirements and strict deadlines.
      <br />
      <br />I am also a college graduate as I recieved a Bachelor's of Business Administration, majoring in Information Technology Management, from Boise State University in the spring of 2019. During my time at Boise State I was able to study wide ranging topics of IT, from Networking to Information Security, and Business Intellengce to System's Planning and Analysis.
