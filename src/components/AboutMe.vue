      Hello, my name is Josiah Aubin and I am currently a software developer at In Time Tec, a global software company located in Meridian, Idaho.
      <br />My first taste of programming was writing a few GUI/desktop apps in C# during a college Intro to Programming class. After that I was hooked and knew that was the career path that I wanted for myself. I enjoy the creativity, structure, and organization that you can pour into each project. My favorite part however is that with each project I have the possibility of creating something that can help improve someone's life.
      <br />
      <br />Before joining the software development workforce I attended Boise CodeWorks, a full-stack software development bootcamp. During my time at BCW I learned multiple front end and back end technologies, as well as completing multiple projects that met specific requirements and strict deadlines.
      <br />I am also a college graduate as I recieved a Bachelor's of Business Administration, majoring in Information Technology Management, from Boise State University in the spring of 2019. During my time at Boise State I was able to study wide ranging topics of IT, from Networking to Information Security, and Business Intellengce to System's Planning and Analysis.
      <br />
      <br />If I am not writing lines of code, you can probably find me:
      <ul>
        <li>Completing main/side missions, capturing objectives, or taking my favorite sports teams to victory in some of my favorite video games.</li>
        <li>Reading techincal and nontechincal books</li>
        <li>Training for Highland Games competions or playing basketball</li>
        <li>Watching one of my favorite shows/movies, or watching a favorite sports team</li>
        <li>Enjoying the great outdoors</li>
        <li>Enjoying the companionship of friends and family</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
